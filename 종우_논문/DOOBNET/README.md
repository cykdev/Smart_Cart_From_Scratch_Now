DOOBNET (Deep Object Occusion Boundary Detection from an Image)

Pascal instance occlusion dataset (PIOD)



 In computer vision, the study of occlusion reasoning has been largely confined to the context of stereo, motion and other multi-view imaging problems

The problem of object occlusion boundary detection relies on having precise object boundary
